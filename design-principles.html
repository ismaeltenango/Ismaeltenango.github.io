      <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>

            <p class='text'>Alignment is the placement of visual elements so they line up in a composition. In design, we use alignment to organize elements, to group elements, 
              to create balance, to create structure, to create connections between elements, to create a sharp and clear outcome. 
              Alignment allows an observer to read the image more easily and clearly. This is achieved by aligning objects to establish order and avoid haphazardly 
              positioning items in the image. there are principles of design that should be considered. These principles are what typically separate good design from bad design. 
              All these principles have a relationship between each other and appear in every well designed piece of work you see.
              A good grasp of design theory will mean there is always substance behind your work.</p>

      <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

      <img
        src="images\desing.png"
        alt="Card" width="100%"/>
          <p class='text'>An efficient and smart web design requires cohesive, clear visual aids so that the visitor has quick and easy access to what they are looking for. 
            Visual hierarchy in web design refers to the arrangement or presentation of elements in a way that implies importance and influences the order in which the human 
            eye perceives what it sees. The theory behind it is that the human brain has “innate organizing tendencies that structure individual elements, shapes or forms into a 
            coherent, organized whole.”
            It’s important to note that in web design, visual hierarchy needs to work in conjunction with functionality. In other words, form and function need to work in 
            perfect harmony. If a website only has beautiful aesthetics, but lacks functionality, the visitor has no way to answer CTAs or purchase a product and will move on to a 
            competitor’s site that meets their needs.</p>

      <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
      <a href='https://www.getquip.com/'>www.getquip.com</a><br>

        alt="Card" width="100%"/>
          <p class='text'>Designers adore it. Website owners want to fill it. What is it? Whitespace! <strong>Whitespace</strong> is one of the most overlooked and underutilized elements that make up a
             great web layout. Too often, whitespace is seen as empty space and, therefore, a waste of screen real estate. However, the truth is that whitespace is one of the most 
             valuable parts of your design. But why is it so important and how do we make sure it is maintained?
             As a designer, I’ve always believed that whitespace is the fundamental building block of good design. When designers talk about whitespace, they actually mean 
             negative space, <strong>the space between elements in a composition.</strong> It is the portion of the page left unmarked; the space between graphics, margins and gutters. It is 
             the space between columns, between lines of type or figures that provides visual breathing room for the eye.</p>
