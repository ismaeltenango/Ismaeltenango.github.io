      <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>

            <p class='text'>Alignment is the placement of visual elements so they line up in a composition. In design, we use alignment to organize elements, to group elements, 
              to create balance, to create structure, to create connections between elements, to create a sharp and clear outcome. 
              I choosed Amazon beacuse is a really big company with a lot of product to chow and offer to the customer, they have to be accurate about where and how they show the 
              product it seems a little bit square with normal figuraes but the allingment makes this website and page easier to understand and easy to navigate thought the pages, 
              some images or boxes are really centered and every corner makes sense with other box corner I like the simplicity and effectiveness of this designe.</p>

      <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

          <p class='text'>
            It’s important to note that in web design, visual hierarchy needs to work in conjunction with functionality. In other words, form and function need to work in 
            perfect harmony. If a website only has beautiful aesthetics, but lacks functionality, the visitor has no way to answer CTAs or purchase a product and will move on to a 
            competitor’s site that meets their needs.
            This website is about a videogame, I really like how they concentrate the web site attention to the videogame and not about the website, I think they are trying
            to show that the videogame is the most fun part of the website an actually there is not much texxt content and this prove again that the <strong>Visual Hierarchy</strong> is 
            focused in the game and not in the text content itself.</p>

      <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
      <a href='https://www.getquip.com/'>www.getquip.com</a><br>
      <img
        src="images\whitespace.png"
        alt="Card" width="100%"/>
          <p class='text'>Designers adore it. Website owners want to fill it. What is it? Whitespace! <strong>Whitespace</strong> is one of the most overlooked and underutilized elements that make up a
             great web layout. Too often, whitespace is seen as empty space and, therefore, a waste of screen real estate. However, the truth is that whitespace is one of the most 
             valuable parts of your design. But why is it so important and how do we make sure it is maintained?
             This website has a lot of <strong>WhiteSpace</strong>. The designers really thought about using the white space to centralize the content in just in the text and the visual appealing
             that the white space gives, besides the images the white space is not focusing in this page isnot focusing in the images, I think it is trying to makes us
             go thtought the page annd read everything on it.</p>
